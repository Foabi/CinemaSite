This project is made in SublimeText.
The project is a cinema site created with HTML and CSS.
You start the program with the "Start.html", from there you will be taken to "Nume.html". These two are the introduction part of the site. Once you are in "Acasă.html" that's the principal part of the site, from there you can go anywhere. 
Acasă - you have the week's movies program with the interval of time in which it appears and the next week's airing movies.
Program - you have the detailed interval of time for each movie.
Oferte - different types of foods and drinks for teenagers, families or groups.
Despre - left corner contact information, middle is just a box with random letters generated with lorem ipsum and a CinemaWatch logo which takes you to the main page.
Covid19 - this is just a page with rules against Covid19 spreading.
